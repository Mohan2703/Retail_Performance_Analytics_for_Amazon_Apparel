## Problem Statement
- The fashion segment on Amazon generates massive amounts of sales and unit-level data across multiple cities and states in India. However, this data is scattered and difficult for stakeholders to interpret quickly.
- The problem : How can we track sales performance, seller activity, and product-level insights to improve decision-making in the apparel category?


## Project Planning using Star Method
<details>
<summary>
$\textsf{\color{blue}{View Stratergy ➡️}}$
</summary><br>

- Understand key KPIs: Overall Sales, Units, Seller Count
- Build hierarchical view: State → City → Product → Product Details
- Enable drilldowns: from overview → product listings → product-level insights
- Design dashboards with clear filters and interactions 

### 📝 S - Situation
Amazon’s apparel sales data was scattered, making it hard for stakeholders to track performance across sellers, cities, and products. A unified, interactive view was needed for better decision-making.

### 🎯 T - Task
- Create Interactive Power BI Dashboard
- Track overall sales, units, and sellers
- Monitor city-wise and state-wise performance
- Provide drillthrough to product and product-level views
- Ensure stakeholders could filter by sales/units dynamically

### ⚡ A - Action
I collected raw Amazon Fashion sales data, cleaned and formatted it, and created a dynamic option to switch between sales and units. Key measures like overall sales, seller count, and reviews were built in Power BI for analysis. Dashboards were designed at three levels — Overview, Products, and Product View — to track performance from high-level trends down to individual products.

### 🏆 R - Result
- The dashboard revealed top-performing states and cities, highlighted product-level gaps such as low-rated SKUs, and gave management a clear tool to track sales and units. 
- By identifying sales trends, high-performing products, and top-selling items, the solution contributed to a **10% increase in revenue**. 
- Additionally, regional sales visualizations **improved market insights by 15%**, enabling more informed strategic planning and faster, data-driven decisions.

## Data Source
>- Imported raw Amazon.xlsx dataset
>- Imported raw amazon-fashion.csv dataset
>- Web Scrapping using Python from Amazon.in

## Data Preprocessing & ETL
**Our data is initially import from the Excel/CSV file into Power BI, and then the subsequent Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) is executed in Power Query**
<br>
1. Cleaned nulls, formatted dates, ensured proper data types.  
2. Image URL Cleaning – split image URLs by delimiter, removed duplicates, and dropped the redundant column **large2**.
3. Data Merge – Joined the Amazon table with the amazon-fashion - YT table on the primary key ASIN to enrich the dataset with additional attributes like Amount or price of product in **Amazon** Table.
4. Null and Zero Handling – Applied up/down fill in Power BI to handle missing or zero values in the Price of Product columns.
5. Category Column Transformation – Split the Category field (using lower/upper case delimiter) into Category1, Category2, and Category3. Replaced null values with blanks, then created a new custom column **"Category"** using:

  ```
   [Category.1] & " " & [Category.2] & " " & [Category.3]
  ```

6. Derived Date Column – Created a new Month column using:

  ```
  Month = FORMAT(Amazon[Date], "mmm")
  ```

## Data Modelling

The Data Model illustrates the correlation between various tables and designed in Power BI to <br> 
connect transactional and reference data for better analysis:

- Tables Used:
  - Amazon Sale Report → core sales, units, pricing, and transactional details
  - amazon-fashion → product metadata (reviews, categories, images, etc.)

- Relationship Setup:
  - Established a **many-to-many** relationship between the two tables using the **ASIN** column as the primary key in both tables.
  - This ensured that each product could be mapped across multiple sales records while preserving product-level attributes from the reference table.

- Key Measures Defined:
  - Over_all_sales → aggregated sales across all categories
  - Seller_count → total sellers with delivered orders
  - Filter_Sale → dynamic toggle between sales and units
  - Sales_Amount, Sales_Units, Reviews

- Derived Columns:
  - Month = FORMAT(Amazon[Date], "mmm")
  - Category (concatenated split categories for better grouping)

```
= var val= CALCULATE([Sale_Units],CONTAINSSTRING(Amazon[Status],"Return"))
return IF(val=BLANK(),0,val)
```

2. Reviews 
```
= var val = COUNT('amazon-fashion'[no__of_reviews])
return IF(ISBLANK(val),0)
```

3. Sale_Ammount 
```
= var val = SUM(Amazon[Total_Ammount])
return if(ISBLANK(val),0)
```

4. Sale_Units 
```
= var selecting = SELECTEDVALUE(Sale_Option[Type])
var _units =SUM(Amazon[Qty])
var _sale = SUM(Amazon[Total_Ammount])
return IF(selecting="1",_sale,_units)
```

5. All_Sale 
```
= CALCULATE([Sale_Units],ALL('amazon-fashion'[Category]))
```

6. Order_Counts 
```
= var val = CALCULATE(COUNT('amazon-fashion'[seller_id]),CONTAINSSTRING(Amazon[Status],"Delivered"))
return IF(val=BLANK(),"0",val)
```

**Calculated Columns:**

1. Month 
```
1.	month = FORMAT(Amazon[Date],"mmm")
```

**Tables Created:**
